# C Programming - More Functions, More Nested Loops

This repository contains C programs created as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. The programs demonstrate various functions and nested loops.

## File Descriptions

0. \_isupper.c
   - Contains a function to check for uppercase characters.

1. \_isdigit.c
   - Contains a function to check for a digit (0 through 9).

2. 2-mul.c
   - Includes a function to multiply two integers.

3. 3-print_numbers.c
   - Prints numbers from 0 to 9 using `_putchar` only twice.

4. 4-print_most_numbers.c
   - Prints numbers from 0 to 9, excluding 2 and 4.

5. 5-more_numbers.c
   - Prints numbers 10 times from 0 to 14.

6. 6-print_line.c
   - Prints a straight line using `_putchar`.

7. 7-print_diagonal.c
   - Prints a diagonal line using `_putchar`.

8. 8-print_square.c
   - Prints a square using `_putchar`.

9. 9-fizz_buzz.c
   - Prints numbers from 1 to 100 with specific rules (Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz).

10. 10-print_triangle.c
    - Prints a triangle using `_putchar`.

11. 100-prime_factor.c
    - Finds the largest prime factor of a specific number.

12. 101-print_number.c
    - Prints an integer using `_putchar`.

## How to Use

Compile the C files using a C compiler such as GCC:

Run the compiled file:
./<output_filename>

Make sure to replace <filename.c> with the relevant C file and <output_filename> with the desired name for the compiled output.

This abbreviated README file provides a brief description of each C file in the repository along with instructions on how to compile and run the programs. Adjustments can be made according to your specific requirements.
