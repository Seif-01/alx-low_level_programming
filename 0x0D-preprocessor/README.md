Project Overview:
C programming project focusing on preprocessor directives and macros. Tasks involve creating header files with macros for numerical constants and function-like macros.

Tasks:

    Object-like Macro (Mandatory)
        Create a header file defining a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.
        File: 0-object_like_macro.h

    Pi (Mandatory)
        Create a header file defining a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.
        File: 1-pi.h

    File Name (Mandatory)
        Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from.
        File: 2-main.c

    Function-like Macro (Mandatory)
        Write a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.
        File: 3-function_like_macro.h

    SUM (Mandatory)
        Write a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.
        File: 4-sum.h
