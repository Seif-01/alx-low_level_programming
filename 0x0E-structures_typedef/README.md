**Project Overview:**
C programming project focusing on defining, initializing, and manipulating structures and typedef for a `dog` type. Tasks include creating, printing, and managing instances of the `dog` structure.

**Tasks:**
1. Define a `struct dog` with specific elements.
2. Implement a function to initialize a `dog` variable.
3. Create a function to print the details of a `dog`.
4. Introduce a new type `dog_t` as an alias for `struct dog`.
5. Develop a function to create a new `dog` and handle memory allocation.
6. Write a function to free memory allocated for a `dog_t` struct.
